## Welcome to my RxJS learning place 👋

> Learning reactive programming with Reactive extensions for Javascript (RxJS). But I'm using typescript also, does that make it RxTS?? 🤔 🤯

Here I've put together a list of examples using Observables and Operators for performing basic tasks a normal web app would need to do.
***
### `TECHNOLOGIES` used
- 📦 [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html)
- [RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/overview)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
***
### Usage
1️⃣ Install all the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
2️⃣ Run the app
```bash
npm start
```
> You can also just run the build command `npm run build` to get the compiled JS bundle.
